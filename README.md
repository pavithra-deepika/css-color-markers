  - RGB Value - rgb(red, green, blue)
     - An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.
         - Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.
 <br></br>        
 - RGBA Value -  rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
    - RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.
    - alpha value set to ( 0 - 1.0)
 <br></br>        
- HEX Value - #rrggbb
    - Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
    - To display white, set all values to ff, like this: #ffffff. 
 <br></br>        
- HSL Value - hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
    - Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
    - Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
    - Lightness is also a percentage. 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white
 <br></br>        
- Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
    - To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.
    - Syntax background-image: linear-gradient(angle, color-stop1, color-stop2)
- Example :   background-image: linear-gradient(180deg, red, yellow);
<br></br>
- The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element.        
<br></br>
- The box-shadow property attaches one or more shadows to an element.
     - Syntax [ offsetX offsetY blur spread color ]
        - offsetY : 
             - The vertical offset of the shadow.A positive value puts the shadow below the box, a negative value puts the shadow above the box
        - offsetX: 
             - The horizontal offset of the shadow. A positive value puts the shadow on the right side of the box, a negative value puts the shadow on the left side of the box
         - blur : 
            - Optional. The blur radius. The higher the number, the more blurred the shadow.

        - spread:
             - Optional. The spread radius. A positive value increases the size of the shadow, a negative value decreases the size of the shadow
        - color:
             - Optional. The color of the shadow. The default value is the text color. Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values
